Midterm Make-Up Project

Our project is an accumluation of scripts that pull data from iNaturalist and complile them into a CSV file. This CSV file is then pushed into the Species Distribution Model provided by the clients and output a heat map based on a specified species and month/year. To allow it to be interactive we have accumlated the neccessary code into a Jupyter Notebook file which takes user input to output the SDM image from the specified year/month for the specified species. We have included all necessary documentation to go along with our scripts and our Cyverse wiki is completely updated.
